Project: GithubAnimate is a GoAnimate LVM revival which is installed offline, but still needs an internet connection for making the videos.
## Our Goals
- Make a lightweight experience to use GoAnimate without needing a legacy web browser and Adobe Flash
- Add a offline functionality for custom assets
## How it will work
- Wrapper: Offline will be a base.
- Assets will be hosted online.
- Requires an internet connection.
- Mods like "Stretch Mod" will be already implemented.
- Some custom assets will be implemented, if you want your custom asset in the app, make a Issue with the tag "Custom Asset" at ThatYellowVyonder/gitanimDB
